Overview
~~~~~~~~

A mod for BG2:EE (2.0 or higher) and EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy) that provides you with a unique dungeon crawling 
experience.

The adventure starts in the Planar Sphere in Athkatla's Slum District, where you may encounter new victims of Lavok's 
planar travels. The result of the encounter will enable you to access a dungeon that has been tailor-made for the 
intrepid adventurer. You have the opportunity to meet exotic races, uncover a devious plot, or simply enjoy battle 
with an endless stream of monsters.


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mod is available for BG2:EE 2.0 or higher and EET. It is strongly recommended to patch the game to 2.5 or higher
to make use of all features the mod has to offer.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive into your game's 
installation directory (where you can find the file "chitin.key") and run "setup-A7-TestYourMettle.exe" (Windows) or
"setup-A7-TestYourMettle.command" (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.

It is not needed to start a new game after installing the mod. However, you must install it before entering the Planar 
Sphere in Athkatla's Slums for the first time.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Test Your Mettle! (requires BG2:EE or EET patched to 2.0 or higher)

This is the main component. It installs new areas, creatures, items, spells and everything else needed for a unique
dungeon crawling experience.


2. Reduce experience for killing monsters (requires the main component)

As the monsters you may encounter in the dungeon are numerous, you will quickly gain a lot of experience that could 
make your party too powerful to enjoy the rest of the game. This component allows you to reduce XP from killing 
monsters by different amounts, or remove XP altogether. Unique monsters or creatures encountered outside the dungeon 
are not affected.
