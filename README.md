# Test Your Mettle!
*A mod for BG2:EE that provides you with a unique dungeon crawling experience.*


## Overview

This mod provides you with a whole new adventure where you can explore new areas, meet exotic races, uncover a devious plot, or simply enjoy battle with an endless stream of monsters.

The adventure starts in the Planar Sphere in Athkatla's Slum District, where you may encounter new victims of Lavok's planar travels. The result of the encounter will enable you to access a dungeon that has been tailor-made for the intrepid adventurer.


## Components

### 1. Test Your Mettle! (requires BG2:EE or EET patched to 2.0 or higher)

This is the main component. It installs new areas, creatures and everything else needed for a unique dungeon crawling experience.

### 2. Reduce experience for killing monsters (requires the main component)

As the monsters you may encounter in the dungeon are numerous, you will quickly gain a lot of experience that could make your party too powerful to enjoy the rest of the game. This component allows you to reduce XP from killing monsters by different amounts, or remove XP altogether. Unique monsters or creatures encountered outside the dungeon are not affected.
